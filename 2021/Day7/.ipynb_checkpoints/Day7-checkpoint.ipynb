    "<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2>--- Day 7: The Treachery of Whales ---</h2><p>A giant <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale\" target=\"_blank\">whale</a> has decided your submarine is its next meal, and it's much faster than you are. There's nowhere to run!</p>\n",
    "<p>Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a <em>massive underground cave system</em> just beyond where they're aiming!</p>\n",
    "<p>The crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through. However, it doesn't look like they'll be aligned before the whale catches you! Maybe you can help?</p>\n",
    "<p>There's one major catch - crab submarines can only move horizontally.</p>\n",
    "<p>You quickly make a list of <em>the horizontal position of each crab</em> (your puzzle input). Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, consider the following horizontal positions:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>This means there's a crab with horizontal position <code>16</code>, a crab with horizontal position <code>1</code>, and so on.</p>\n",
    "<p>Each change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1 fuel. You could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal position <code>2</code>:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Move from <code>16</code> to <code>2</code>: <code>14</code> fuel</li>\n",
    "<li>Move from <code>1</code> to <code>2</code>: <code>1</code> fuel</li>\n",
    "<li>Move from <code>2</code> to <code>2</code>: <code>0</code> fuel</li>\n",
    "<li>Move from <code>0</code> to <code>2</code>: <code>2</code> fuel</li>\n",
    "<li>Move from <code>4</code> to <code>2</code>: <code>2</code> fuel</li>\n",
    "<li>Move from <code>2</code> to <code>2</code>: <code>0</code> fuel</li>\n",
    "<li>Move from <code>7</code> to <code>2</code>: <code>5</code> fuel</li>\n",
    "<li>Move from <code>1</code> to <code>2</code>: <code>1</code> fuel</li>\n",
    "<li>Move from <code>2</code> to <code>2</code>: <code>0</code> fuel</li>\n",
    "<li>Move from <code>14</code> to <code>2</code>: <code>12</code> fuel</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>This costs a total of <code><em>37</em></code> fuel. This is the cheapest possible outcome; more expensive outcomes include aligning at position <code>1</code> (<code>41</code> fuel), position <code>3</code> (<code>39</code> fuel), or position <code>10</code> (<code>71</code> fuel).</p>\n",
    "<p>Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible. <em>How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?</em></p>\n",
